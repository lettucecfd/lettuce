We need

    Ma=0.3 is stable, above is discouraged)

    scale to physical units)

Per default, lt.Obstacle has no solid. It is stored in flow.mask as a fully

For a circle, just use a boolean function. Otherwise, you may as well use the

The collision is usually BGK (low dissipation, but may be unstable) or KBC
