GPU-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Simulations in Python
-------------------------------------------------------

Lettuce is a Computational Fluid Dynamics framework based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM).

- **GPU-Accelerated Computation**: Utilizes PyTorch for high performance and efficient GPU utilization.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Supports both 2D and 3D simulations for quick and reliable analysis.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Integrates neural networks and automatic differentiation to enhance LBM.
- **Optimized Performance**: Includes custom PyTorch extensions for native CUDA kernels.

Getting Started
---------------

To find some very simple examples of how to use lettuce, please have a look at the examples_. These will guide you through lettuce's main features. Please ensure you have Jupyter installed to run the Jupyter notebooks.

.. _examples: https://github.com/lettucecfd/lettuce/tree/master/examples

Installation
------------

* Install the uv package manager from https://docs.astral.sh/uv/

* Clone this repository from github and change to it::

    git clone https://github.com/lettucecfd/lettuce
    cd lettuce

* Create a new virtual environment and activate it::

    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

* The `pyproject.toml` file currently requires at least **CUDA 12.4** (we successfully tested CUDA 12.4, 12.6 and 12.8). If your GPU does not support this version, you may need to downgrade it. Please note that we cannot guarantee the maintenance for older CUDA versions.

* If you want to only **use** lettuce, run the installation (from the lettuce base directory!).::

    uv pip install .

* If you do not have access to a GPU or an older GPU, you can install the CPU-only version or older CUDA supported versions of lettuce by using the following commands. (cpu, cu124, cu126)::

    uv pip install ".[cpu]"

* If you are a **developer**, add the changeable-installation-flag (`-e`)::

    uv pip install -e .

* Check out the convergence order, running on CPU::

    lettuce --no-cuda convergence

* For running a CUDA-driven LBM simulation on one GPU omit the `--no-cuda`. If CUDA is not found, make sure that cuda drivers are installed and compatible with the installed cudatoolkit.

* Check out the performance, running on GPU::

    lettuce benchmark

* Run the test cases::

    pytest tests
